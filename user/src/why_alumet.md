# Why ALUMET and not \<X\>?

Every tool comes with its limitations, and Alumet is not the only measurement software out there. Here is why we think that Alumet may be better than other existing tools.

- extensibility: _todo_ Some tools claim that they have a plugin interface and a modular code. In Alumet, this is done in a way that is _actually_ both easy to use and powerful. The first evidence of this advantage is that the core and the plugins are in distinct crates, rather than in a monolithic codebase. For instance, Alumet plugins have less restrictions than Telegraf plugins.
- performance: _todo_
- dynamic reconfiguration: _todo_

## Does it work on \<Y>\?

For now, Alumet works in the following environments:
